A comprehensive security auditing tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Automatically detects vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security weaknesses in MCP deployments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Tool?

With over **7,000 MCP servers** currently exposed on the internet, many lack proper security controls. This scanner helps identify and remediate critical security issues before they're exploited.
