# Security Best Practices

## For Scanner Users

### Authorization
**Always obtain authorization** before scanning systems you don't own.

### Responsible Disclosure
If you find vulnerabilities:
1. Don't exploit them
2. Report to the system owner
3. Allow time for fixes
4. Coordinate public disclosure

### Data Handling
- Don't share scan results publicly
- Secure your reports directory
- Delete old reports

## For MCP Server Operators

### Findings & Remediation

#### CRITICAL: Missing Authentication
**Fix:**
```yaml
# Add API key authentication
authentication:
  type: api_key
  header: X-API-Key
  keys:
    - "your-secure-key-here"
```

#### HIGH: Unencrypted Connection
**Fix:**
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Configure TLS 1.2 or higher
- Disable weak ciphers
```nginx
# Nginx example
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
```

#### CRITICAL: Dangerous Tools Exposed
**Fix:**
- Implement role-based access control
- Validate all inputs
- Use principle of least privilege
- Enable audit logging

### Monitoring
- Log all access attempts
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Set up alerting
- Regular security audits

### Updates
- Keep MCP server updated
- Patch vulnerabilities promptly
- Review security advisories
